Pack of various image sequences vfx that I made for my game.

They are all in range 8-64 frames and some of them are loopable.

Most of the effects are made using Effekseer > https://effekseer.github.io/en/index.html
For some effects I used free resources from Unity Labs Paris > https://blog.unity.com/technology/free-vfx-image-sequences-flipbooks

Not all vfx are great, but I hope you find at least some of them useful :)
